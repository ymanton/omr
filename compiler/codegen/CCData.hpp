/**
 * @class CCData
 *
 * @brief This class represents a table that can be used to store data that will be referenced from generated code.
 *
 * When generating code, we typically have the option to embed constants in the instruction stream in the form of immediate operands, data snippets, and
 * by allocating chunks of memory directly from the code cache. Alternatively, data can be allocated as static variables accessible via the symbol table.
 * This class represents a third method for allocating data in a single, contiguous table. Allocations can specify custom alignment requirements and optionally
 * be associated with a key.
 *
 * The intention is for CCData tables to store constants, addresses, and other site-specific data, such as inline caches separately from the instruction stream
 * itself such that the code can be made read-only (i.e. never needs to be patched), can be made position-independent, and process-independent.
 *
 * The memory backing a CCData table must be allocated externally and should be done so to facilitate access from a particular code cache. On architectures that
 * provide PC-relative data access instructions, the memory should be allocated within the addressible distance of those instructions.
 *
 * Alternatively, a register may be used as a base pointer, however note that currently data is allocated from the table at increasing addresses, which may be
 * sub-optimal for architectures that use signed displacements to access data.

       * Unique Object Representations
       *
       * Structs and classes usually have padding bytes which are going to be included in their memory representations.
       * Even if the padding is at the end of the instance, sizeof() will include it. Calculating a key based on the memory
       * representation is going to include the padding, which is incorrect. If the key includes the padding, two otherwise
       * equal objects will result in different keys if their padding bytes differ.
       *
       * This also applies to floats and doubles because of various "don't care" (DC) bits in the binary representation.
       * Logically equal float values might have different bit patterns and would result in different keys.
       *
       * Types that don't have any padding or DC bits have unique object representations in C++ standard parlance.
       *
       * Guidance
       *
       * On capable (C++17) compilers, a static assertion will check for the std::has_unique_object_representations<T> type trait.
       * On incapable compilers, only simple integrals should be used to create keys. Avoid floats, doubles, structs, classes,
       * unions, and any other type who's object representation may include undefined bits or bytes.
